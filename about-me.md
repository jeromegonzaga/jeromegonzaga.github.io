# A little bit about me...

Hi! My name is Jerome Gonzaga and I love data science! Although I studied civil engineering back when I was in college, I love to use computer programming to analyze data and to automate my work so that I can make the computer do the repetitive things and I can get to other important tasks. Throughout my career I have also used computer programming to build tools for many of my coworkers so that they could benefit from computer automation. it wasn't until late 2019 when I stumbled upon the field of data science and realized how beneficial it could be to apply data science to the work and analysis that I do on a day-to-day basis.

As I have been upscaling my skillsets to include many data science skills and techniques, my hope is to go into a life-long career of applying data science to real-world problems and to assist myself and others in making more data-driven decisions!
